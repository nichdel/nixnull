I think you become old when art stops changing you.

This is a list of *influential* art. It's not the same thing as a recommendation list. Some of this has Aged, some of it is Problematic, much of it I disagree with now either in part or whole. But it's things that moved me, stuck with me, transformed me in some way.

It's an Eventually Goal to have a short description of how all these have impacted me and what I think about them now.

Things by the same creator in the same category are on the same line; they likely influenced me in similar ways.

* Furcadia - This is a very old, very furry oriented, creative online game. I don't consider myself a furry, I have no idea how I originally found this game. But I got hooked into a community there, including one person who is still a friend to this day. It was a strange, welcoming, and in many ways (but not all) very progressive community that made me aware of people living their lives, happily, in ways that society looked down on then (and for many of them, in ways that society still looks down on now). There was largely a sense of acceptance of different attitudes and lived experiences that has guided me well throughout my life.
* Gravity Bone, Thirty Flights of Loving, and Quadrilateral Cowboy
* The Stanley Parable and The Beginner's Guide
