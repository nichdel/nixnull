I think you become old when art stops changing you.

This is a list of *influential* art. It's not the same thing as a recommendation list. Some of this has Aged, some of it is Problematic, much of it I disagree with now either in part or whole. But it's things that moved me, stuck with me, transformed me in some way.

It's an Eventually Goal to have a short description of how all these have impacted me and what I think about them now.

Things by the same creator in the same category are on the same line; they likely influenced me in similar ways.

Anime
-----

* Serial Experiments Lain - My earliest introduction to true pure cyberpunk and transhumanism. I still love to read theories about it.
* FLCL
* Toradora - This isn't a very deep inclusion. I like slow burn love stories with flawed characters and a lot of tearjerking.
* Neon Genesis Evangelion
* Cowboy Bebop
* Haruhi Suzumiya - Haruhi Suzumiya was, in retrospect, the opening point for my venture into Magical Realism and modern fantasy. It balanced explaining itself and forcing you to just go with it in pleasing ways. And it had startling artistic depth (Endless Eight, the allusions to Rosencrantz and Guildernstern Are Dead) juxtaposed with silly light storytelling. It's not without problems, notably the excessively long fanservice scenes that increasingly annoy me in anime as I get older and grumpier. But there's a lot to love about it, especially the movie.

Books
-----

* Haruhi Suzumiya - While I was introduced to this via the TV series, I understood Kyon much more deeply in the visual novels. See the anime section for more proper gushing.
* Dune - When I was young I found this viewpoint compelling. The revolutionary power of the rugged individual from a powerful bloodline with a powerful coalition of religious zealots behind him. Now, I can see where Herbert's ideas came from. But man, did he poorly predict the future. He poorly understood how technology would impact life, and how geopolitics would change alongside it. Most importantly, his idea of the violently righteous just doesn't resonate with me in any way anymore.
* That Was Then, This is Now
* Little, Big and Engine Summer
* Factfulness - This one is a recommendation. This book will teach you to think about progress in the world in a different way. The short of its thesis is that we don't notice slow progress, so we don't notice that life on average gets better worldwide every year. But trust me, there's so much more to this book that will change how you think.

Movies
------

* Big Fish - Watched this with my dad, and loved it for its storytelling and uniqueness. He has since passed away. Just watch it to understand why that has strengthened my connection to it.
* Primer
* Moonrise Kingdom - Love Wes Anderson, love quirky love stories. Yes.
* 5cm Per Second

Music
-----

* Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space by Spiritualized
* Illinois by Sufjan Stevens

Webcomics
---------

* A Lesson is Learned
* The entire tacklefordverse by John Allison
* Questionable Content
* DMFA

Videogames
----------

* Bioshock 1 & 2
* Dwarf Fortress
* Furcadia - This is a very old, very furry oriented, creative online game. I don't consider myself a furry, I have no idea how I originally found this game. But I got hooked into a community there, including one person who is still a friend to this day. It was a strange, welcoming, and in many ways (but not all) very progressive community that made me aware of people living their lives, happily, in ways that society looked down on then (and for many of them, in ways that society still looks down on now). There was largely a sense of acceptance of different attitudes and lived experiences that has guided me well throughout my life.
* Gravity Bone, Thirty Flights of Loving, and Quadrilateral Cowboy
* The Stanley Parable and The Beginner's Guide
* Life is Strange
