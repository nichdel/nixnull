The wikipedia article for personal wikis says:

``"A personal wiki is wiki software that allows individual users to organize information on their desktop or mobile computing devices in a manner similar to community wikis, but without collaborative software or multiple users."``

Wikipedia is, of course, wrong. When I was growing up (inbetween the age of usenet and the age of five corporate websites running everything), a personal wiki was a website where an individual curated their own opinions and knowledge for no benefit except the mortifying ordeal of being known in a sincere way.

Due to their nature, and the nature of much of the internet at that time, you only knew about them through reference from a friend on instant messenger or a forum or another personal wiki. Websites that can't be found easily through search engines made up a large portion of the daily experience of geeks in my youth; now we call it "the deep web" and over-rely on the algorithms of google to present to us anything useful.

This is my attempt to create my own personal wiki. It will be subjective, it will be wrong, you'll probably disagree. But I'll be honest and open and hopefully you'll get some value out of this that can't be gotten via profit and alogrithm driven websites.

If you want to see personal wikis from their height, look up Everything Shii Knows as a start.
